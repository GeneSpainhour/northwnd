# EntityStateService<T> - An "Flux Like" Angular Service.

Project Goals:
  * Impliment the SOLID flux principles
  * Transparent to Components

The previous version of our EntityServices were perfectly adequate, but the two-way update architecture made the components too complex. The flux/redux architecture
EntityStateService<T> provides state information to components.
